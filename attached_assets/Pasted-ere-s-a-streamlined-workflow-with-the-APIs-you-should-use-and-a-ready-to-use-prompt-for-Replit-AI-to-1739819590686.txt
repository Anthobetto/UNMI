ereâ€™s a streamlined workflow with the APIs you should use and a ready-to-use prompt for Replit AI to implement your call management system:

Workflow Overview
Call Detection & Classification:

Detect incoming calls via Twilio API.

Classify calls as answered or unanswered using Twilio's call status webhook.

Unanswered Call Handling:

If unanswered, trigger a WhatsApp/SMS message using Twilio API (for SMS) and WhatsApp Business API (for WhatsApp).

Send a customizable template with dynamic fields (e.g., business name, CTA links).

Data Update:

Log call details (caller ID, time, status) in a database.

Track message delivery status (WhatsApp/SMS) and update the dashboard.

APIs to Use
Twilio API:

Call Tracking: Detect incoming calls and classify them as answered/unanswered.

SMS Messaging: Send SMS to users.

WhatsApp Messaging: Use Twilio's WhatsApp integration (via WhatsApp Business API).

WhatsApp Business API:

Send WhatsApp messages with pre-approved templates.

Track delivery status and user interactions.

Database API:

Use Firebase Firestore or Supabase for real-time data storage and updates.

Webhook Integration:

Use Twilio webhooks to trigger actions (e.g., send WhatsApp/SMS) when a call is unanswered.

"Create a call management system using Twilio and WhatsApp Business API with the following workflow:

1. **Call Detection & Classification:**
   - Use Twilio's Voice API to detect incoming calls.
   - Classify calls as `answered` or `unanswered` using Twilio's call status webhook:
     ```javascript
     app.post('/call-status', (req, res) => {
       const status = req.body.CallStatus;
       if (status === 'no-answer' || status === 'failed') {
         triggerWhatsAppOrSMS(req.body.From, req.body.To);
       }
       res.status(200).end();
     });
     ```

2. **Unanswered Call Handling:**
   - If a call is unanswered, send a WhatsApp/SMS message:
     - Use **WhatsApp Business API** for WhatsApp messages.
     - Use **Twilio SMS API** for SMS fallback.
   - Send a customizable template with dynamic fields:
     ```json
     {
       "template_name": "unanswered_call",
       "parameters": {
         "business_name": "{{business_name}}",
         "cta_link": "https://booking.com/{{caller_id}}"
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Message Sending Logic:**
   - Decide between WhatsApp or SMS based on user preference or number validity:
     ```python
     def select_message_channel(phone_number):
         if is_whatsapp_user(phone_number):
             return "whatsapp"
         else:
             return "sms"
     ```

4. **Data Logging & Dashboard:**
   - Log call details in a Firestore/Supabase database:
     ```json
     {
       "caller_id": "+123456789",
       "called_number": "+987654321",
       "status": "unanswered",
       "timestamp": "2024-03-01T12:00:00Z",
       "message_sent": true,
       "message_channel": "whatsapp"
     }
     ```
   - Update the dashboard in real-time with:
     - Call history (answered/unanswered).
     - Message delivery status.

5. **APIs & Integrations:**
   - **Twilio API** for call tracking and SMS.
   - **WhatsApp Business API** for WhatsApp messages.
   - **Firestore/Supabase** for real-time data storage.
   - **Webhooks** for triggering actions.

6. **Deliverables:**
   - Code for call detection and classification.
   - Logic for sending WhatsApp/SMS templates.
   - Real-time dashboard integration.
   - Example webhook implementation.

7. **Optimizations:**
   - Use caching (Redis) for frequently accessed data.
   - Implement rate limiting for WhatsApp/SMS sending.
   - Add retry logic for failed message deliveries.

8. **Example Code:**
   ```javascript
   // Twilio webhook handler
   app.post('/incoming-call', (req, res) => {
     const caller = req.body.From;
     const called = req.body.To;
     const status = req.body.CallStatus;

     if (status === 'no-answer') {
       const channel = select_message_channel(caller);
       const template = generate_template(called, caller);
       send_message(channel, template);
     }

     log_call(caller, called, status);
     res.status(200).end();
   });
Cost Optimization:

Use Twilio's pay-as-you-go pricing for calls and SMS.

Use WhatsApp Business API for high-volume messaging (cheaper than SMS).

Cache templates and user preferences to reduce API calls.

Error Handling:

Retry failed WhatsApp/SMS sends up to 3 times.

Log errors for debugging and analytics.

   - Real-time detection of answered/unanswered calls.
   - Webhook-based triggers for actions.

2. **Dynamic Messaging**:
   - Customizable WhatsApp/SMS templates.
   - Fallback to SMS if WhatsApp is unavailable.

3. **Real-Time Dashboard**:
   - Track call history and message delivery status.
   - Monitor usage and performance.

4. **Scalable & Cost-Effective**:
   - Use Twilio's pay-as-you-go model.
   - Optimize message delivery with caching and retries.

### **Example Workflow**
1. A call comes in to a business number.
2. Twilio detects the call and classifies it as **unanswered**.
3. The system triggers a WhatsApp message with a pre-approved template:
Hi {{name}}, we missed your call! Book an appointment here: {{cta_link}}

Copy
4. If WhatsApp is unavailable, an SMS is sent instead.
5. The call and message details are logged in the database and displayed on the dashboard.
